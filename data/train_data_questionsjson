    "Which of the following descriptions accurately describes Azure Machine Learning? A Python library that you can use as an alternative to common machine learning frameworks like Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, and Tensorflow. An application for Microsoft Windows that enables you to create machine learning models by using a drag and drop interface. A cloud-based platform for operating machine learning solutions at scale.",
    "Correct. Azure Machine Learning is an Azure service that you can use to manage machine learning model data preparation, training, validation, and deployment. It leverages existing frameworks such as Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, and Tensorflow; and provides a cross-platform platform for operationalizing machine learning in the cloud."
